Streamlit app for colorizing black and white photos

Prompt
“Given a black and white photo, colorize it”

Approaches
- simple binning (pixels in [0,1])
- neural style network (advanced)

UX
- Website
- upload photo from url or file
- show them the photo they uploaded
- let them choose the colorscheme (colormaps)
- let them download the result (easily, with a button)
- (maybe) have a min/max value for pixels. everything outside of them is a flat color. clipping mask

Questions
- how do we get an image from a link? (requests.get().content), bytesIO from io
- once we have the image, how do we load it to a matrix?
- if we get a color image, how do we handle it? grayscale it first.
- how do we get an image from their upload filepath?
- can we use PIL.ImageOps.colorize? (mode: PIL / PyPlot / NN )
- how do we get a list of all the mpl colormaps to supply the user with as options
- how do we use pyplot to save an image (no axes or borders)
